## Runing presentative PWMs for a TF that have multiple expriments in one or more biosamples

User need to provide a table where the name of a TF, its biosample, expremweental ID, and the mac2 peak file (see peaks_for_experiments).
The rankingTF.sh will run the pipeline in three steps:
1. Obtain represnetative peaks for a TF wich has multiple expriments in a same biosample using ranking method
2. Obtain represnetative peaks for a TF that has done in mutiple biosample and choose the top 500 peaks
3. Run motif discovry tool, MEME-ChIP, and gather the inferred PWMs.

To run it, please download python scripts and store them in a folder, and create another new working folder for runing and stroing outputs by this pipeline.
The more information can see in the bash shell script of rankingTF.sh.
