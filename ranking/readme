Runing presentative PWMs for a TF that have multiple expriments in one or more biosamples
User nned to provide a table where the name of a TF, its biosample, expremweental ID, and the mac2 peak file (see peaks_for_experiments).
The rankingTF.sh will run the pipeline in three steps:
1. Obtain represnetative peaks for a TF wich has multiple expriments in a same biosample using ranking method
2. Obtain represnetative peaks for a TF that has done in mutiple biosample and choose the top 500 peaks
3. Run motif discovry tool, MEME-ChIP, and gather the inferred PWMs.
