## Runing presentative PWMs for a TF that have multiple expriments in one or more biosamples

User need to provide a table where the name of a TF, its biosample, expremweental ID, and the mac2 peak file (see peaks_for_experiments).
The rankingTF.sh will run the pipeline in three steps:
1. Obtain represnetative peaks for a TF wich has multiple expriments in a same biosample using ranking method
2. Obtain represnetative peaks for a TF that has done in mutiple biosample and choose the top 500 peaks
3. Run motif discovry tool, MEME-ChIP, and gather the inferred PWMs.

To run it, please download python scripts and store them in a folder, and create another new working folder where it includes rankingTF.sh,
then run the shell script by
bash rankingTF.sh
all the outputs will be stored in the working folder.
For more information, please see rankingTF.sh script.
